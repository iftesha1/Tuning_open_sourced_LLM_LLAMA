# Tuning_open_sourced_LLM_LLAMA
This repo contains all the collective work related to open-sourced LLM Llama. 
Mostly how to effectively load the large models and fine-tune the llama models.

- Model Loading: Successfully loaded large open-source LLama models using Hugging Face's quantized versions to ensure efficient memory usage and faster inference times.
- Fine-Tuning: Demonstrated effective fine-tuning of the pre-trained LLama models to tailor their functionalities for specific tasks and improve performance.
- Utilization of Hugging Face: Leveraged the Hugging Face library to simplify the loading and fine-tuning process, showcasing practical knowledge in utilizing industry-standard tools for NLP tasks
